This package contains UV/X-ray background (UVB) model data in electronic form from the paper 

"A 2019 Cosmic UV/X-ray Background Model Update"

by C.-A. Faucher-Giguere (the 'FG19' model).


Three types of files are provided and identified by the following strings:

 - *_treecool_*.dat: Photoionization rates and photoheating rates in table that can be
                     directly used with the GADGET, GIZMO, and Arepo codes (possibly others). 
                       
                     Simply replace the file TREECOOL in your code directory to use the model
                     in a simulation.

                     Files ending '_thin.dat' correspond to rates computed directly from a 
                     UVB model obtained by solving the cosmological radiative transfer
                     equation for a spatially-homogeneous UVB (incorrect assumption prior to
                     reionization).
                     
                     Files ending in '_eff_*.dat' correspond to modified TREECOOL files that
                     use "effective" photoionization and photoheating rates prior to
                     reionization (see the paper for details).

                     The 'fg19_fiducial_treecool_eff_default.dat' file corresponds to the
                     fiducial FG19 UVB model with the default reionization history parameters
                     used in the paper.

 
                     The columns in TREECOOL files are:
  
  log(1+z), Gamma_HI, Gamma_HeI, Gamma_HeII, qdot_HI, qdot_HeI, qdot_HeII

  where 'Gamma' is a photoionization rate and 'qdot' is a photoheating rate.  
  
  The Gamma's are in units of s^-1, and the qdot's are in units of erg s^-1.


 - *_spec_lambda.dat: Full UVB spectrum as a function of wavelength and redshift. Same ASCII
                      file format as used to distribute the HM12 UVB model
                      (see http://www.ucolick.org/~pmadau/CUBA/DOWNLOADS.html).
                   

  line 1 contains 51 fields identifying the sampling redshifts, from 0 to 10.

  lines 2 through 542: the first field is the rest-frame wavelength in Angstroms, 
  and fields 2 through 52 give the background intensity J in units of ergs/s/cm^2/Hz/sr 
  at the 51 sampling redshifts. 

  
  *_spec_lambda_cloudy.dat: Identical format but with 9 additional lines at the beginning. 
                            These lines are formatted such that this file can replace the 
                            HM12 model in Cloudy. I.e., if you replace the Cloudy data file 
                            'hm12_galaxy.ascii' in Cloudy's 'data' subdirectory with this
                            file, then the commands normally employed to use the HM12 model 
                            in Cloudy will instead use the FG19 model.

                            This is provided for convenience until a separate command to use 
                            the FG19 model is added to Cloudy.


 - *_spec_nu.dat: Similar format as *_spec_lambda.dat, but frequencies in unit of Ry instead
                  of wavelengths in A, and spectrum J in units of 10^-21 ergs/s/cm^2/Hz/sr. 


The full spectrum files are only provided for the background models computed in the 
homogeneous approximation (there are no 'effective' spectra defined before reionization).


Different prefixes and suffixes indicate variants relative the fiducial UVB model and default
reionization history. At present, we only provide variants for the HI reionization 
parameters, in the subdirectory 'reion_variants.'


The following series of TREECOOL files vary the redshift of HI reionization (the z_rei,HI
parameter in the paper) but all other parameters are as in the fiducial spectral model and 
default reionization history:

 - fg19_fiducial_treecool_eff_zreiHI6.dat  -- z_rei,HI=6
 - fg19_fiducial_treecool_eff_zreiHI7.dat  -- z_rei,HI=7 
 - fg19_fiducial_treecool_eff_zreiHI8.dat  -- z_rei,HI=8


The following vary the amount of heat injected during HI reionization (the parameter Delta
T_HI in the paper) but all other parameters are as in the fiducial spectral model and default 
reionization history (the redshift of HI reionization is fixed at z_rei,HI=7.7). Default is Delta T_HI=20000K.

 - fg19_fiducial_treecool_eff_DeltaTHI1e4.dat  -- Delta T_HI=10000 K
 - fg19_fiducial_treecool_eff_DeltaTHI3e4.dat  -- Delta T_HI=30000 K
 - fg19_fiducial_treecool_eff_DeltaTHI4e4.dat  -- Delta T_HI=40000 K
